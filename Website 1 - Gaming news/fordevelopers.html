Earlier this year at Google I/O, we previewed Brillo and Weave, our complete solution for building connected devices.
Since May, we’ve opened up the Brillo operating system (OS) and Weave communication platform to early access partners. 
Today, we’re extending this to the broader developer community as part of our invite program. Read on to find out how you can receive an invitation.

Brillo brings the simplicity and speed of software development to hardware by offering you a lightweight embedded OS based on Android,
core services, a developer kit, and a developer console. You can choose from a variety of hardware capabilities and customization options, 
quickly move from prototype to production, and manage at scale with over the air (OTA) updates, metrics, and crash reporting.

Once you’ve built your connected device, you’ll need to find a way for it to communicate with other devices and allow users to interact with it.
 That’s where Weave comes in. With Weave, you can build interoperable communications directly into your devices. Weave provides a messaging
 service that enables phones and devices to talk to each other locally and remotely through the cloud. The Weave cloud server handles remote 
 communication and access to your web-connected device, safely and at scale. With Weave you also get a set of services to securely set up the
 device and provide controlled access. Additionally, Weave works seamlessly with, and is actually built right into, Brillo; but, you can also
 use Weave libraries with your existing Linux-based OS.
 
 Weave comes with a mobile SDK for both iOS and Android, so that you can build apps to control and enhance the connected device experience for 
 mobile users. If you’re an app developer interested in extending the reach of your apps to the physical world of devices, you can use Weave 
 mobile and web APIs to control multiple Weave devices across brands in a single app.

Both Brillo and Weave are open, extensible, and secure by default to support a variety of devices and use cases. Brillo and Weave provide
 the platform, tools and services, so you can do what you do best: build great device and app experiences.

In addition to the Brillo and Weave platforms, we’re also unveiling our Weave compatibility program to ship certified Weave-branded devices 
as well as a hardware program for silicon vendors to build and sell Brillo-compliant hardware.

If you’d like to be part of our developer invite program, visit our website and request an invite. We’ll send you more details as well as 
access to our code, documentation and developer console. We look forward to making the Internet of Things better, together!

			You may think you understand a topic but its not until you are having to explain it to someone who doesn’t understand your made up
			terminology and rules of thumb that you realise what you really know and what you just pretend to understand.
			
			Last year one of my colleagues sent round an email announcing a Skills Amnesty. A chance to confess that you didn’t really understand 
			how shell scripts work, or what it means to skew your CSS transform or why you have to use triple equals in JavaScript.

People were free to submit topics anonymously and then once we had the topics people volunteered to run training sessions that anyone could attend.
 Hugo Gibson has already written about his algorithms class.

I was surprised to find that a few people had put down Python as something they wanted to learn about and volunteered to give some lessons.
 I had been a bit surprised that people wanted to learn about it given that most Guardian developers’ preferred language is Scala.
 The missing element turned out to be data science and the use of scripting for data munging and the use of libraries like NumPy.
 
 I have never taught Python before, I have always been more of a student, therefore I looked around for a few models that I could use to
 shape the course. A whole language with a lot of history was an intimidating challenge to present and also ran the risk of overwhelming the students.

At the initial meeting with those interested in the course we decided that the lessons would be based around Python 2.7 and that it would
 use a test-driven approach with unit tests illustrating the talk and whiteboard work.

I used Dive into Python and Learn Python the Hard Way to form the basis of what I was going to talk about and to shape what beginners might need to know. 
The final list of topics runs as follows:

Datatypes: strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dictionaries and sets
Comprehensions
Functions, including modules and import syntax
Classes and named tuples
Reflection
Regular expressions
On top of this there will also be some special sessions on file IO, library usage, web frameworks, web scraping and APIs.

You can see the repository that I use for the lessons on GitHub and I plan to open source it once I have run through it completely with the first students.

			Discovering the answers
Advertisement

Having got a rough idea of the topics writing the tests to illustrate the behaviour of the various data types and syntax turned
 out to be really hard. I discovered that there is a whole lot of Python I do not really use in my own programming.

For example: what happens when you divide one by two (you get zero)? What happens when you put lambda into the projection of a list
 comprehension (you get a list of anonymous functions)? What order do decorators get executed in? What happens to an existing 
 instance of an object when you redefine the class it substantiates?

Sometimes I would anticipate things and have a test already written to show how something worked but part of the fun of working with
 an interactive language like Python is that often we could just dive into the shell during the session and find out what would happen together.

Doing the lessons has turned out to be a great learning experience for me as well. I now know the set literal syntax, but only after
 I wrote entirely wrong syntax on a whiteboard. I also now know that pass behaves differently depending on where you put it, it is a
 function and a class all in one! I know a lot more about how Python provides object-orientation.

I have had to really think about what I think makes for good Python programming and have tried to distil that insight into a few pieces
 of advice and some illustrations in code.

You rarely think formally about your skills and knowledge in this way. Your colleagues also challenge you to explain why one approach 
is better than others so you cannot simply jazz-hands your way through. If something is good then you should be able to explain why it 
is better than the alternatives that other people might have used or seen in other codebases.

I am looking forward to finishing my teaching and being able to attend some of the other classes but I have already had to improve what 
I thought I already knew. Teaching has provided a friendly but sceptical audience and through their questions a valuable way to learn and get better.

			Game design notes 
by Jordan Anton aka RiotWrekz 
Designing a marksman who could head into the jungle came with a bunch of unique challenges, but notbecause it was a completely new concept. Truth is, we’d seen players crowbar other ranged champs into the jungle before, and by paying attention to where they struggled, we ended up with a pretty good idea of what Kindred needed in order to succeed. 
Macgyvering Jungle Marksmen 
The ranged champs we’ve seen appear in the jungle - most recently Twisted Fate and Twitch - have been really gimmicky, and either dominate a game or do absolutely nothing. Their early ganks are often devastating (not many can survive invisible red buff ganks or TF’s guaranteed stun), but they’re pretty much useless if they fall behind, and absolutely need kill or assist money to keep up. What’s more, anyone familiar with either of their super predictable jungle paths will know where they need to be to kill or maim them, and because they were designed for life in lane, there’s very little they can do against strong counter-junglers like Lee Sin or Rek’Sai. These were all issues we had in mind when we started working on Kindred, and issues we hoped to address while creating the champ. 
"We’d seen players crowbar other ranged champs into the jungle before, and by paying attention to where they struggled, we ended up with a pretty good idea of what Kindred needed in order to succeed. "
Enter Kindred 
First off, we knew that we wanted Kindred to offer their team reasonable ganks - attacks that, if timed and coordinated well, could result in a kill, but weren’t guaranteed successes. By reducing the power of their ganks - specifically compared to Twitch or Twisted Fate - we were able to add power to areas where they both struggle. We made Kindred less reliant on money, so while they obviously benefit from items as the game progresses, they aren’t anything like as useless as the Plague Rat when he falls the wrong side of the feast/famine divide. Mark of the Kindred, for example, is a really snazzy ability, not just from the bonuses it gives Kindred, but because it adds a psychological element to a game of League that’slargely indifferent to Kindred’s strength. Whether you’ve been marked by a Kindred that’s racked up a 10/0 or a 0/10 score, you’re going to playdifferently. Maybe you’re about to get ganked, or maybe Kindred just wanted to apply a smidge of suggested pressure - you don’t know, and, unless you’ve warded supremely well, you won’t know until they appear somewhere on the map. 
Speaking of ganks, while Kindred’s aren’t as brutal as Twitch’s or TF’s, they’re still plenty powerful, and will often relieve pressure even if they don’t secure a kill. The percent max health burst damage from a fully triggered Mounting Dread means Kindred’s ganks sting even against tanks, and the W/Q combo helps Kindred stick to their target as they make their escape. Kindred definitely lacks the hard crowd control that a lot of junglers bring to a fight, but the extra damage they bring in lieu of the cc means they thrive especially when they gank lanes that do have the means to keep their target from fleeing. So while junglers like Sejuani and Rek’Sai bring the knock-ups and slows the gank needs, but often lack the damage to kill the target, Kindred offers the inverse to that. 

Mixing the meta 
Kindred’s introduction brings the possibility of fancy new team comps built around a second jungling marksman. With two marksmen, the rest of the team might look for peel-heavy champions who can keep enemy assassins and fighters at bay, or pick up items like Black Cleaver to help both marksmen deal decent damage. Maybe they’ll focus instead on tanky frontline characters who pack a decent amount of magic damage - champs like Malphite or Amumu - to mix up their team’s damage output. The point is that a ranged marksmen jungler hasn’t really been reliably seen before, and we’re super excited to see the kinds of teams you guys build around one. 
Finally, I can’t talk about Kindred without mentioning their ultimate. Lamb’s Respite is another ability that is effective regardless of Kindred’s level of success in the game, and again encourages teams to think outside the box in regards to their composition. Its death-defying zone gives sustained damage comps resistance to burst, which reinforces double AD comps and specifically rewards teams which pack in multiple marksmen. But even if Kindred’s taken into a more traditional team comp, they should still be able to offer their team plenty of unique tools along with those coveted ranged attacks. 
"Lamb’s Respite is another ability that is effective regardless of Kindred’s level of success in the game, and again encourages teams to think outside the box in regards to their composition. " 
Narrative notes 
by Matt Dunn aka FauxSchizzle

We had a hook for the kit pretty early in ideation: a jungle marksman with the ability to “mark” enemy players for death and reap rewards for each successful kill or assist on that target. This led the team to explore several ways of expressing the champion’s growing power, and we landed on a relationship between two equals. This is where Kindred took shape. 
It was ultimately one of Chris’ sketches - a glowing ethereal lamb firing a shadowy wolf from its bow - that piqued our interest. In fact, it haunted us. There was something darkly whimsical about this duo, so we decided to dig deeper. This is typically when the Narrative writers dream up a few story sketches to figure out who the champ is within Runeterra, what their powers look like, and how they behave. The first lines I wrote for this concept were a variation on their “choose me” line, with Wolf saying “Tell me again, little Lamb, which things are mine to take?” and Lamb replying bluntly, “All things, dear Wolf.” 
Based on lots of discussions in the room, we realized that Kindred could be Runeterra’s first mythological representation of life and death. We dreamt up scenarios from ancient barrows featuring rough engravings of the Kindred masks to mark the sites as places of the dead, to a Mardi Gras meets Groundhog Day-style celebration in Bilgewater. Kindred’s stories were designed to build up the mythological foundation of Runeterra; the stuff of fables and nursery rhymes that children sang, blissfully unaware of the works’ dark origins. 
These two animals: the stalwart Lamb with her ornate bow, and the shadowy Wolf with his tongue lolling out of his mouth, felt both quirky and ominous. I started researching the anthropomorphism of death throughout numerous cultures and found that many of humanity’s first known myths were centered around gravesites. The team agreed that Kindred was a unique grim reaper, spoken about in whispered tones by those who narrowly avoided death, and seen by all in life’s last moments. To help clarify what made the characters distinct, we took a look at what a Lamb’s death looks like in comparison to a Wolf’s. To accept Lamb is to rejoice in life and depart in serenity. To run from Wolf means a violent and terrifying end. 
The masks proved pivotal to the champ. By having Lamb wear Wolf’s mask - and vice versa - we tapped into a yin-yang dynamic, which helped us crack their personalities. We gave in spades to one what the other lacked. In this case, Lamb knew much about the world, but felt very little, whereas Wolf felt everything, but lacked in the knowledge department. We loved the idea that these two never fought over kills, or were ever at odds, because, in the end, the Lamb and the Wolf are two parts of one whole. 
"The first lines I wrote for this concept were a variation on their “choose me” line, with Wolf saying “Tell me again, little Lamb, which things are mine to take?” and Lamb replying bluntly, “All things, dear Wolf.”"
Art notes 
by Edmundo Sanchez aka Mundo and Chris Campbell aka Skeeziks 
After identifying the type of champion we wanted to make (in this case, a dual character jungling marksman), we entered open ideation, and started noodling on what these characters would actually look like. But, turns out dual characters are hard. We tried out a couple of ideas, but they trod on existing champions a little too hard and failed to get much support internally. Other ideas came and went until we found ourselves spinning our wheels two weeks into our four week ideation window. Chris, looking for a change of environment, headed out to a coffee shop for a while to continue sketching. A few hours later, he turned back up, and opened up his sketchbook to show us this:
